title: Getting started

Python is a general-purpose programming language, and there are many ways in which you can use it.


## Anaconda and Spyder

If you're unsure how to get started, then I recommend that you download Anaconda, which is a Python distribution that comes with many useful packages pre-installed. Notably, Anaconda comes with Spyder preinstalled, which is a good Python editor.

1. Visit <http://anaconda.org/>, click on *Download Anaconda*, and download the 64 bit version for Python 3
2. Once the `.exe` installer has been download, launch it and follow the steps to install *Anaconda* on your system. The default settings are generally fine.
3. Launch *Spyder*!

In *Spyder*, enter the code `print('Hello world!')`, select this code, and press F9 to execute it. This will execute this line of code in the so-called IPython Console, which by default is on the bottom-right of the window. You can also type directly into this console.

All set up? Then let's begin with exploring the basic Python [syntax](%url:syntax%)!
