There are many ways in which you can install and use Python.


## Python 2 or 3?

There are two main versions of Python: 2 and 3. The recommended version is Python 3, which is newer and actively maintained. Python 2 is still widely used, but only because some Python libraries have not yet been updated to be compatible with Python 3.


## Anaconda

If you're unsure how to get started, then I recommend that you download Anaconda. Anaconda is a Python distribution that comes with many useful packages pre-installed. Notably, comes with Spyder preinstalled.

1. Visit <http://anaconda.org/>, click on *Download Anaconda*, and download the 64 bit version for Python 3
2. Once the `.exe` installer has been download, launch it and follow the steps to install Anaconda on your system. The default installation settings are generally fine.
3. Now launch Spyder, which has been installed as part of Anaconda.

In Spyder, enter the code `print('Hello world!')` in the editor window, select it and press F9 to execute. This will execute this line of code in the so-called IPython Console, which by default is on the bottom-right of the window. You can also type directly into this console.

All set up? Then let's begin with exploring the basic Python [syntax](%url:syntax%)!
