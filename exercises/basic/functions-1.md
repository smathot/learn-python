The [factorial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorial) (`!`) of a positive integer number is the product of all numbers from 1 up to and including the number itself. So `3! == 3 × 2 × 1`. By convention, `0! == 1`. The factorial of negative numbers is undefined.

Define a function that takes a number as an argument, and returns the factorial for that number. The function can assume that the input is a non-negative integer. Use a `for` loop inside the function.
