Imagine a right triangle like the one above and:

- Read a number from the standard input and assign it to `a`
- Read another number from the standard input and assign it to `b`
- Use Pythagoras theorem to determine the value of the long side `c`
- Use string formatting to print out the length of the long side
- If `c` is larger than `PI` (a constant), also print out: *And this is longer than PI*
