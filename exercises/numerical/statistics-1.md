Above you have seen how to conduct a two-way repeated measures ANOVA with [this dataset](/data/zhou_et_al_2020_exp1.csv) from Zhou et al. (2020). But the data contains a third factor: congruency. First, run a three-way repeated measures ANOVA with target-match, distractor-match, and congruency as independent variables, and search accuracy as dependent variable. Next, plot the results in a two-panel plot, where the left subplot shows the effect of distractor and target match for congruent trials, while the right subplot shows this for incongruent trials.
